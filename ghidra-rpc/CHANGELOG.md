# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`ghidra-rpc mcp`**: stdio MCP server exposing every CLI command as a tool.
  Schemas are generated from the Click parameters and calls run the CLI
  in-process, so the MCP surface cannot drift from the CLI. No new dependency.
- **`ghidra-rpc batch`**: run many commands in one process (argv lists or
  command strings), with per-item results and `--stop-on-error`.
- **Cancellation**: a request is cancelled when its client disconnects (e.g.
  socket timeout, Ctrl+C) or via the new `cancel` command / `cancel` built-in
  RPC. Decompiler calls get a cancellable `TaskMonitor`; sweeps stop between
  functions. `ping`/`status` list `active_requests`.
- **Decompile cache**: per-program cache shared by `decompile`,
  `search-decompiled`, `decompile-all` and `function-diff`, invalidated
  whenever the program's modification number changes.
- **Parallel sweeps**: `search-decompiled` and `decompile-all` decompile across
  the decompiler pool, now sized by `GHIDRA_RPC_DECOMPILERS` (default
  min(4, CPUs), previously a fixed 2 that the global lock left unused).
- **`--max-chars`** on `decompile` and `decompile-all` to truncate huge
  functions (`truncated`, `c_code_length` in the response).
- **`--save-mode deferred`** on `start`/`restart`: writes mark programs dirty;
  flushed on `save`, every 30 s and on shutdown.

- **Full Windows support: headless and GUI mode.**
  - **Transport**: `ghidra_rpc/transport.py` abstracts the IPC layer.
    Windows (no `AF_UNIX`) uses a token-authenticated TCP listener on
    `127.0.0.1` instead of a Unix domain socket; port/token live in
    `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ghidra-rpc\ghidra-rpc-<hash>.sock`. Wire format and CLI
    are unchanged on all platforms.
  - **`--detach`**: uses `DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP |
    CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` on Windows (`start_new_session` is a no-op
    there). `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` is required for the daemon to
    survive launchers that use Job Objects, e.g. OpenSSH's `sshd`.
  - **GUI mode**: now works on Windows. Fixed
    `GuiContext._normalize_project_location()` to handle
    `ProjectLocator.getLocation()`'s leading-slash-before-drive-letter form
    (`/C:/test/`), which `pathlib` misparsed as a relative path, making the
    daemon's project-open check always fail.
  - **CI**: `tests.yml` (unit suite, Ubuntu/macOS/Windows) and
    `integration.yml` (112-test Ghidra suite) cover headless Windows. GUI
    mode has no CI coverage (no display in the runner).

### Changed

- **Read-only commands run concurrently.** The global handler lock is now a
  writer-preferring reader/writer lock: reads share it, writes (and any
  handler not listed in `READ_ONLY_COMMANDS`) stay exclusive.
- **Breaking (safety):** commands that modify the program no longer accept a
  substring match for a function name — `rename-function bin init x` used to
  rename `_init_array_helper` silently when no `init` existed. They now
  require an exact name or an address and list the candidates otherwise.
  Read commands still accept a unique substring and flag it with
  `resolved_by: "partial"` and a `warning`.
- Function lookup by exact name goes through the symbol table instead of
  scanning every function; namespace-qualified names (`Foo::bar`) and
  `space:offset` / bare-hex addresses are accepted.
- A client-side socket timeout is reported as a `Timeout` error envelope
  instead of a bare `TimeoutError`.
- POSIX sockets are created mode `0600`, and the client refuses to connect to
  an endpoint that is not a socket owned by the current user.
- Requests larger than 32 MiB are rejected (`RequestTooLarge`).
- **Breaking:** `disassemble` no longer returns the `instructions` array by
  default — it was a verbatim duplicate of the `listing` string, which already
  carries every field it did (address, bytes, mnemonic, operands, EOL comment;
  only `length` is absent, and that is the byte count). Pass
  `--with-instructions` when you need the machine-parseable array. The default
  response is roughly a quarter the size, measured across `--count` 8 to 500.
  `ghidra-rpc disassemble <binary> <address>` now returns
  `{address, count, listing}`; add `--with-instructions` for the previous shape.

### Fixed

- Binary lookup reported an exact name as ambiguous when it was also a
  substring of another loaded program's key (`ls` vs `lsblk`).
- `xrefs-to <binary> strcmp` could resolve to an unrelated function such as
  `my_strcmp` via substring match before trying symbols (e.g. an import).
- The server-side default `decompile` timeout was 60 s while the CLI and docs
  said 120 s.

- `--detach`'d daemons lost their persisted `ghidra_install_dir` moments
  after starting, on every platform: the detached child re-saves its own
  `Session` from bare `--mode`/`--project` argv, clobbering the parent's
  value with `null`. This broke `send_request_with_auto_restart` healing a
  dead daemon from an environment without `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` set (cron,
  sudo, a bare ssh call). Fixed by passing `--ghidra-install-dir` to the
  child too.

- Tests: socket-binding tests now use a short temp directory. macOS caps
  `AF_UNIX` `sun_path` at 104 bytes (Linux allows 108) and pytest's `tmp_path`
  there is rooted under `/private/var/folders/<random>/T/...`, already ~120
  bytes, so every test that bound a socket failed with
  `OSError: AF_UNIX path too long`. A `short_tmp_path` fixture in
  `tests/conftest.py` roots those under `/tmp` instead. Test-harness only —
  real endpoints are `/tmp/ghidra-rpc-<hash>.sock` at 29 bytes and were never
  affected. This is what kept macOS out of the CI matrix.

- Headless mode: a write that aborted mid-transaction could silently discard
  the *next* successful write on the following save, even an unrelated write
  from a later command (see
  https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/9347).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- `symbols` missed labels containing spaces (including CJK/multi-word strings
  with a space anywhere in them), because Ghidra's `SymbolUtilities` replaces
  literal ASCII spaces — and only spaces, no other character, ASCII or not —
  with `_` when it auto-generates a label from string content (e.g. DEX
  `strings::`/`string_data::` labels). A query pasted verbatim from `strings`
  output therefore had spaces where the label had underscores and never
  matched. `symbols` now normalizes spaces/underscores as equivalent before
  comparing. Confirmed against a real multidex APK project and reproduced at
  the Ghidra bytecode level (`SymbolUtilities.INVALIDCHARS` is `{' '}`) before
  fixing.
- CLI usage errors (unknown options, invalid `--type`/`--mode` choices, unknown
  subcommands, missing required arguments) previously printed a plain-text Click
  usage string, breaking the documented "all output is JSON" contract for scripted
  callers. `main()` now runs Click in non-standalone mode and reports these as the
  same `{"ok": false, "error": ..., "message": ...}` envelope as RPC errors, with
  the same exit code Click would have used. `--help`/`--version` are unaffected.
- `list-instances`/`stop --all` globbed the *real* `/tmp` for orphaned sockets with
  no way for tests to redirect it, so a test-invoked `stop --all` could stop a real
  daemon running on the developer's machine (observed while testing this release).
  The scan directory is now `cli._SOCKET_SCAN_DIR`, a module attribute tests can
  monkeypatch to a `tmp_path`; production behaviour (`/tmp`) is unchanged.
- `list-namespaces` returned an empty list for DEX/Dalvik programs. The handler
  scanned `getSymbolIterator()`, which only yields memory-location labels and so
  missed DEX package (`createNameSpace`) and class (`createClass`) namespaces
  — none of which are memory labels. It now walks the namespace tree from the
  global namespace via `getChildren()`, which works uniformly for native
  (ELF/PE) and DEX programs. Added integration regression tests
  (`TestDexNamespaces`, `TestNamespacesNative`).

### Added

- `search-decompiled` command: regex-search decompiled C across many functions in
  one RPC call, optionally scoped to a namespace/class with `--class`. Replaces the
  one-RPC-per-function `symbols` + `decompile` + grep loop previously needed to find
  which function calls a given callee, builds a given string, etc. — especially
  valuable on multidex Android projects, where `xrefs-to` on a method only sees
  callers within the same DEX program (see below). Bounded by `--limit` (matching
  functions returned) and
  `--max-scan` (functions actually decompiled, default 5000) so an unscoped sweep on
  a 50k+-function binary can't run away; both `search-decompiled` and `decompile-all`
  gained a `--socket-timeout` option (default 1800s) since a bulk sweep's wall-clock
  cost scales with function count, not with the per-function `--timeout`.
- `list-bookmarks --category`: case-insensitive substring filter on bookmark
  category, alongside the existing `--type` filter. Helps isolate user-created
  bookmarks from Ghidra's auto-generated `Analysis`-type ones (commonly category
  `Address Table`), which can otherwise number in the hundreds on large/heavily
  analyzed programs and bury a handful of user bookmarks in the default listing.
- `xrefs-to --all-binaries`: also search every other currently loaded binary
  for a symbol with the same fully-qualified name and merge in real callers
  found there (each merged entry carries a `binary` field). Fixes the common
  multidex case where a method's only callers live in a *different* loaded
  `classesN.dex` — Ghidra's `ReferenceManager`/`SymbolTable` are per-`Program`,
  so a single-binary `xrefs-to` can't see a reference whose source and target
  live in two different loaded programs; this isn't a Dalvik-analyzer gap,
  and isn't DEX-specific — the same limitation applies to any ghidra-rpc
  project with more than one binary loaded. Documented in
  `docs/flows/android-apk.md`.

- Android APK / DEX analysis guidance: new `docs/flows/android-apk.md` flow and a
  SKILL.md section covering Ghidra's built-in Dalvik/APK/DEX loaders, the
  class-qualified `::` symbol naming, ambiguous-method handling, the
  **multi-dex caveat** (`load app.apk` imports only the primary `classes.dex`;
  extract each `classes*.dex` and load them individually to cover the whole app),
  and the DEX **string vs. symbol address** behavior (`strings` reports the
  string-content address; use the `strings::`-labeled address from `symbols` for
  `xrefs-to`, since the two differ by the variable-length uleb128 prefix).

- `create-struct` explicit-offset layout: pass `--field OFFSET TYPE NAME`
  (repeatable; OFFSET is decimal or `0x` hex) to place fields at exact byte
  offsets. Gaps are auto-padded with undefined bytes — no manual pad fields —
  and overlapping fields are rejected. The original sequential `TYPE NAME`
  form is unchanged.
- `read-pointers` command: read N pointer-sized words at an address and resolve
  each to its function/symbol (respecting endianness and pointer size). Useful for
  vtables, import/jump tables, and RTTI pointer arrays.
- `list-vtable` command: dump a C++ vtable's slots as resolved methods. Accepts a
  symbol name or address; without an explicit count it stops at the next vftable
  symbol or the first non-function pointer, reporting `stopped_reason`.
- `batch-edit-variable` command: rename and/or retype many local variables in a
  single decompiler snapshot and one transaction. Fixes the auto-name renumbering
  that breaks chained single `rename-variable`/`retype-variable` calls, and lets you
  address a variable by its stable `storage` string (e.g. `Stack[-0x18]:4`, `EAX:4`)
  in addition to its current name. Per-item results carry a `verified` read-back flag.
- `rename-variable` command for renaming local variables in decompiler output.
- `list-instances` command to show all running daemon instances, and a
  `stop --all` flag to stop them all at once.
- Global session registry so daemons register/unregister themselves on
  start/stop; `ping` now reports `project_gpr`, `mode`, and `pid`.
- Integration test suite exercising every API domain against a real headless
  Ghidra daemon, plus supporting test fixtures.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `set-comment` now takes comment text via `--comment` instead of a
  positional argument, matching `set-bookmark`'s `--comment` option (previously the
  only command in the annotate-at-address family using a bare positional for the
  same field — a natural source of `Error: No such option '--comment'`).
  `ghidra-rpc set-comment <binary> <address> "text" --type plate` becomes
  `ghidra-rpc set-comment <binary> <address> --comment "text" --type plate`.
- Background daemon startup now fails fast with the captured daemon log if
  the subprocess exits early, instead of waiting out the full timeout.

### Fixed

- `find-bytes` tool.
- `xrefs` address resolution now prefers non-external symbols and handles
  thunk functions correctly, fixing inaccurate cross-reference lookups.
- GUI mode project mismatch detection: the daemon passes the `.gpr` path to
  `GhidraRun` so Ghidra opens the requested project on startup instead of
  restoring the last-used one, and `list-project-programs` now detects and
  warns about post-startup project switches in GUI mode.
